## Problem 1:

Convolutional neural networks have been really popular in different domains like Images, Time
series etc. Use the ‘ChlorineConcentration’ dataset from the attachment and design a classifier
using CNN. The training and test samples ratio should be 70% and 30% respectively. The
minimum expected test accuracy is 90%.
Feel free to try with different hyperparameters and include all the insights in your
documentation.

## Problem 2:

Autoencoder is a very popular deep learning model for unsupervised learning. The most
amazing fact about Autoencoder is, it has capability of representing data in low dimensional
space and extracting interesting patterns. Use Autoencoder to perform clustering over
‘ElectricDevices’ dataset and the minimum expectation is to bring good results than any
traditional clustering algorithm (preferrably KMeans). Take a look at the paper link below and
you can use the architecture proposed in the paper (You can use other architecture if you are
not convinced by this paper, don’t forget to cite the paper in your document).
